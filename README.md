Useful code chunks

**gmail code**: Send emails from a configured gmail account. Requires to & from email accounts, with a from account which has had relaxed security settings. Requires the "Allow less secure apps" to be set to "ON". Alternative is to use OAuth for secure access (see here <a> https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python </a> )
